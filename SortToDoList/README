Welcome to The Challenge!

In this challenge, you will need to sort a TO DO List by the following properties: Priority, Category, and Progress

Priority: Highest->Lowest (1 is the higest...5 is the lowest)
Category: Alphabetical
Progress: Highest->Lowest (100% is the highest...0% is the lowest)

You must write two scripts over the course of a Two Week Timeline:

WEEK1/WEEK2
"SortToDoList.sh" should sort a given file by a specific property. The file "SortToDoList.sh" should take in two parameters: "File Name" and "Property" It should output the sorted To Do List in a file. 

Additionally, try to implement some features to protect against malicious attacks. Max will try to exploit your scripts. Ex: Trying to organize by something other than Category, Priority, or Progress. Giving invalid files names.

WEEK2
"test.sh" should take two parameters: "Golden_File" and "Your_File" It should compare the two to tell you whether you completed the challenge or not!

The "Challenge" directory should contain your two scripts and output files

The "Tests" directory contains the To Do Lists and the Golden Outputs

The "Solution" directory contains my solution. Do not look at this JASON!

Some Helpful Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running Scripts: A Script is just a series of shell commands that can be interpreted sequentially by the shell interpreter. In this case, the Bourne-Again Shell or BASH. 

You can write the script in any IDE or Text Editor you want!

Scripts must begin with the SHEBANG, which should be "#!/bin/bash" normally.

Scripts must be given the +x permission in order to execute. Check this by running:
>: chmod +x ./"script_name"

Passing environmental parameters to scripts can be done by including extra stuff at the end of a script call:
>: ./"script_name" "parameter1" "parameter2"
>: ./SortToDoList.sh ../Tests/ToDoList1 Category
>: ./SortToDoList.sh ../Tests/ToDoList2 Priority

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the Test Cases: In the "Test" directory, you are given two To Do List as test cases. There is also a set of GOLDEN SOLUTIONS. These are the correct solution to each of the test cases. 

Running your "test.sh" script is easy:
>: ./test.sh "Your_solution_file_name" "Golden_solution_file_name"

Hints for the Challenge:
> BASH already has a built in command to sort a file: sort
The following command might help you understand this better
>: sort --help
